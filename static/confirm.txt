We develop this website just for internal use.
We are currently manage a entertainment page at https://www.facebook.com/chinhphuchoanmy/
We have a lot of video upload on Youtube and Facebook also.
So we want to manage our video right on Facebook.

To do that we should upload one by one video on FB Creator site in "Right Manager" => "Reference Library", it take a lot of time, because we can't upload bulk of videos at a time.
We develop that web application to help us save the uploading time.

To use this page:
1. Login our FB account that has right to access our FB Page.
2. Selects videos we want to upload in Right Manager
3. Upload configure file, that content how these videos are setting when upload to Right Manager (Rule, name,â€¦)
4. Click "Start Upload" to begin (still under-developing due to waiting this App Review)

To upload video to Right Manager with reference_only: we need
publish_pages and manage_pages permissions.
